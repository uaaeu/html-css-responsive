          <p>
            JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The programs in this language are called <i>scripts</i>. They can be
            written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page
            loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need
            special preparation or compilation to run.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
            called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"
              >Java</a
            >.
          </p>
          <div class="boxed">
            <p>
              <strong> &#8505;    Why is it called <u>Java</u>Script?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
              “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
              decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of
              Java would help.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
              with its own specification called
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>,
              and now it has no relation to Java at all.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
            the server, or actually on any device that has a special program
            called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine">
              the JavaScript engine </a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript
            virtual machine”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">
                V8
              </a>
              – in Chrome and Opera.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey"
                >SpiderMonkey
              </a>
              – in Firefox.
            </li>
            <li>
              …There are other codenames like “Trident” and “Chakra” for
              different versions of IE, “ChakraCore” for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro”
              and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The terms above are good to remember because they are used in
            developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For
            instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably
            works in Chrome and Opera.
          </p>
          <div class="boxed">
            <p>
              <strong> &#8505;    How do engines work?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the
                script.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine
                language.
              </li>
              <li>
                And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It
              even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data
              that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code
              based on that knowledge.

          <p>
            Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
            provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially
            created for browsers which do not require it.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
            running in. For instance,
            <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js</a> supports
            functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files,
            perform network requests, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage
            manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify
              styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key
              presses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and
              upload files (so-called
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"
                >AJAX</a
              >
              and

              technologies).
            </li>
            <li>
              Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).

        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of
            the user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from
            accessing private information or harming the user’s data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of such restrictions include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on
                the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct
                access to OS functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is
                limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like
                “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it via an
                <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are ways to interact with camera/microphone and other
                devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission. So a
                JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera,
                observe the surroundings and send the information to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"
                  >NSA</a
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
                Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript
                to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from
                one page may not access the other if they come from different
                sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is called the “Same Origin Policy”. To work around that,
                both pages must agree for data exchange and contain a special
                JavaScript code that handles it. We’ll cover that in the
                tutorial.
              </p>
              <p>
                This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety. A page from
                <code>http://anysite.com</code> which a user has opened must not
                be able to access another browser tab with the URL
                <code>http://gmail.com</code> and steal information from there.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server
                where the current page came from. But its ability to receive
                data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it
                requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the
                remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such limits do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the
                browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow
                plugin/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.

        <article>
          <p>There are at least <i>three</i> great things about JavaScript:</p>
          <div class="boxed">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Full integration with HTML/CSS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple things are done simply.
              </li>
              <li>
                Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most
            widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, JavaScript also allows to create servers, mobile
            applications, etc.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Languages_“over”_JavaScript">
        <header>Languages “over” JavaScript</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different
            people want different features.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are
            different for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            So recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are
            transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent,
            actually allowing developers to code in another language and
            auto-converting it “under the hood”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of such languages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> is a
              “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax,
              allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby
              devs like it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> is
              concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the
              development and support of complex systems. It is developed by
              <code>Microsoft</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://flow.org/">Flow</a> also adds data typing, but in
              a different way. Developed by <code>Facebook</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> is a standalone
              language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser
              environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to
              JavaScript. Developed by <code>Google</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are more. Of course, even if we use one of transpiled
            languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand what
            we’re doing.

              JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but
              is now used in many other environments as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted
              browser language with full integration with HTML/CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and
              provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at
              them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
